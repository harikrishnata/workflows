# Matrix Build with Artifacts (DevOps Challenge)

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that demonstrates a multi-platform **matrix build** with artifact upload.

- Matrix: `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`
- Each job creates and uploads a unique JSON artifact named `build-54227a3-<os>`
